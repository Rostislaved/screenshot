Version history
==============

### Version 2.0.0
* Changed: linux and freebsd source code is one file now
* Changed: linux (and freebsd) code refactored
* Changed: Connection to X in linux is separated from screenshoting

 Last change was the reason to make a fork. Creating connection allocate memory and doesn't release it what makes impossible to make screenshots in a loop

### Version 1.0.0

* Forked from vova616 (2020-04-26)
